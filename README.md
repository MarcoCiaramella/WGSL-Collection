# WGSL-Collection
A WGSL collection of functions for WebGPU.
## Testing
Since WebGPU is still experimental you can play with it on [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/it/chrome/canary/) and enable at `chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`.
## How to contribute
Contributions are welcome! You can submit your function by opening a pull request and provide a directory with shader.wgsl, index.js and index.html files with a working sample inside.
